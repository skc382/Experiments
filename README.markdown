  ```
- **Expected Response** (in development):
  ```bash
  {"response": [{"text": "It's wonderful to see Aarav Sharma engaging in a variety of activities both 
  in and out of the classroom. In addition to his academic pursuits, Aarav has shown a strong interest 
  in Indian Classical Dance, which is a fantastic way to express creativity and cultural pride. Completing 
  a dance performance must have filled him with a sense of accomplishment and joy. This involvement not
   only enhances his artistic skills but also boosts his confidence and sense of community. 
  It's great to see how Aarav balances his studies with enriching extracurricular activities, which contribute to his overall growth and development."
